<h4>
In this project we are developing an application in which it will allow users to maintain a digital automated diary for expenses. User will login or sign up (for new user) to use this application. Once user has logged in with their credentials they can track their income and expense on a day to day basis. This Application is supported to all the physical devices(like Smart Phones e.t.c.) that uses android operating system that has the capability of storing the data internally.<br><br><br><br></h4>

<h4>What are the achieved Features of the application?<br></h4>

In this Smart cash manager entity, we have attributes like add income, add expense, view income/ expense, and add savings. In this table add expense, add income, and add savings are the composite primary key in which we can uniquely identify one cash transaction (which is nothing but addition of income, expense and savings to the database).

  </ul><br><br>

<h4>What is the Sequence Information of the application ?<br></h4>
New User ---> SignUp --->SignIn (with generated credentials) --->Home page --> Actionbar (NavigationControls)  ---> (Home, income, add income, expenses, add expenses, reports, logout).

We can logout from any fragment that is present in the actionbar navigation list. We can also go from one fragment to another using these navigation control(to and fro).
